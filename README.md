## RunMyProcess (Fujitsu Company) Augmented Reality Application for Mangers

#### SSH key: `git@github.com:danielabbasi/managers-augmented-reality.git`

Created an augmented reality app for managers in a highly agile team of 3 to visually see and interact with different departments progress within an office space.

Using Unity and Vuforia to develop an application that recognises different target images and display graphical information accordingly.

Using C# scripts to make the external API calls provided by the client, filter through the data and populate 3d interactive graphs.
